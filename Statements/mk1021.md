## **Introduction**

During the project I have learnt a lot and had a lot of fun building the Single Cycle F1 Light Sequence and then the Reference Program. It was quite fascinating to see how everything came together. I was incharge of the testbench and the Reference Program. I also helped with small bits here and there.

---

## **Instrmem.mem**

For the F1 sequence to run, the neopixels have to light up one at a time and then all turn off at the same time. Each neopixel lights up if the corresponding binary bit is ‘1’, therefore a shift to the left  was implemented and then one is added so that if we start at ‘1’, the next a0 should be ‘10’ + ‘01’ = ‘11’. Using the *SHIFT LEFT IMMEDIATE* instruction meant that the number of bits shifted could be set as the imm. 

> **SLLI rd, rs1, imm** = SLLI a1, a1, 1

To delay each light by a set time a jump and link (JAL) instruction has been implemented. This jumps to the 'Delay' subroutine in which 100 cycles of doing nothing is done and then the program returns to the main. The whole process is run again until a0 = 0xff (11111111 in binary). It then switches off after going through the delay subroutine a final time. To finish, the main jumps and links to a finish subroutine where there’s an infinite loop. This infinite loop is run by checking a0 with t3 which will never equal so therefore won’t branch. 

With Shreya's help, I managed to write out assembly language and put it into the assembler to give out assembly code. We also did translate each instruction into machine code to ensure it's the right instruction.

**Final assembly language:**

> **Counter_main:**   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi t1, zero, 0xff    <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi a0, zero, 0x0	   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi a1, zero, 0x0	   <br>	
**mloop:**  <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; slli a1, a1, 1		   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi a1, a1, 1		   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi a0, a1, 1		   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jal ra, delay		   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bne a1, t1, mloop	   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jal ra, finish		   <br>	
**Delay:**  <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi t0, zero, 0x0	   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi t2, zero, 10	   <br>	
**dloop:**  <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi t0, t0, 1		   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bne t0, t2, dloop	   <br>	
**Finish:** <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi a0, a0, 0x0	   <br>	
**floop:**  <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addi t3, zero, 0x3	   <br>	
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bne t3, zero, floop	   <br>	


Putting the assembly language above into the online RISC-V assembler gives us this assembly code that was put into *Instrmem.mem*.

## **Control Unit**

THe control Unit was mainly assigned to Hana. She designed and wrote out the controls for *ADDI*, *JAL*, *BNE* and *JALR*. She used the tables given in the slides to figure out how to write the psuedoinstructions for these and then used the map, also given in the slides, to figure out what controls need to be turned on and when.

At first Hana hardcoded a few signals as default signals which correlated to the *BNE* instruction. However me and Shreya thought it'd be better, especially when we added in more instructions like *LUI*, *ADD*, *LBU*, *LW*, *SW* and *SB*. We implemented *SW* ad *LW* (word instructions) to understand how to do the byte versions (*LBU* and *SB*). The default had now become all 0's and then for each instruction we have an if/elseif/else statement with the condition as the opcode and the funct3 (if that instruction has a funct3). For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208195453-907fa2af-6246-4b21-a7f3-a29fb9702fbe.png)

So for the instruction *ADD* the opcode is '0110011' and funct3 is '000'. If the relevant bits of the 32 bit instruction matched then the controls signals to enable *ADD* instruction would have been turned on. 

All the signals for the instructions were inside an always_comb loop as we used if/elseif/else statements. In future, I think doing this as cases would've been a better idea as the runtime would have decreased. If/elseif/else statements run through each 'if' condition to check which matches, whereas case means just that case switch is turned on which is much quicker as there's less to check. 

I did this on Shreya's computer and committed and pushed through her VS Code as we worked on it together. Shreya then organised the instructions based on their type.

## **Datamem.sv**

I helped Shreya build this sheet. 

Our processor has been build byte addressed. By this I mean that the hex instruction is split into 4 bytes and each byte is stored individually. You load all 4 bytes and concatentate them together via little endian. 

Shreya had the idea of introducing another control signal 'addr_mode' which distinguished between word and byte instructions. So if addr_mode = 1, then the instructions *LBU* and *SB* will be carried out. 

An 'always_ff' loop was used for store instructions as they're synchronous, they happen on the positive edge of the clock cycles. Signals write_enable and addr_mode must be on to carry out any store instructions. If *SW* was being carried out, then the whole word gets stored in the corresponding bytes. However for *SB* to pick which byte to be stored we used the last two bits of the input 'a_in'. So if the last 2 bits of 'a_in' were '01' the last byte of 'wd_in' would be stored as the third byte of the word stored in data_mem_array. The default case is the last byte of 'wd_in' is stored as the last byte of the word being stored in data_mem_array.

For load instructions we no longer need an 'always_ff' block so we started using an 'always_comb' however it gave us some latch errors so we used 'always_latch' instead. Here, again, for the word there wasn't much to really think about as the whole 4 bytes are taken, and concatenated together. With the load byte instruction however, we again used the input 'a_in' to decide which byte of the word in data_mem_array was being loaded out into the last byte of ReadData_out. As it's a byte instruction, addr_mode = 1 but as it's a load instruction we_in = 0 as we aren't storing/writing anything into the data_mem_array.

For this whole sheet, the order of the byte addressing and which byte goes where was a little confusing but we managed to figure it out in the end. 

--- 

## **Top.sv**

At first we tried running it with just these changes, and when it didn't work we realised we had implemented *LB* and not *LBU*. The difference is that *LBU* is unsigned therefore it's signextended with '0's. However nothing goes into the sign extende block so instead Shreya had the idea to implement this sign extend before the end multiplexer. 

We turned this final multiplexer into a 2 bit multiplexer. The sign extension is executed within the multiplexer. 24 bits of '0's are concatenated with the byte that's been loaded out. The other cases were for other instructions, for example the *JAL* instruction as the return address needs to be stored so that it can link back. 

Similarly there's another 'always_comb' block as a multiplexer for the next_PC. This also is a 2 bit multiplexer and there are 3 cases. The default is pC+4. The other two cases are for branch and *JALR* as for those instructions PC needs to be changed to something completely different, PC+4 is not needed.

I also helped with wiring some signals for the f1 single cycle non-pipelined version.

*corresponding commit* : [*8da51fed42d1f94cea1786e93910ded2fff730a1*](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/8da51fed42d1f94cea1786e93910ded2fff730a1)

## **Top_tb.cpp**

- f1 sequence non-pipelined version
- reference prog with non-pipeplined version
- f1 sequence pipelined version (testbench doesn't really change for that)


Using the old testbenches as templates I built a testbench a general testbench to test our instructions to see if they run on the vbuddy. 
 
>vbdBar(int(top->a0) & 0xFF); is the function that is used to light up the neopixels 

As vbdBar takes the output a0, we made sure that a0 incremented from '1' to '11' and so on, until '11111111' and then after a little delay it switches off. 
The video evidence of this working is on our group deliverable (README file) but I have a screenshot of the wavetrace below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208181915-ab54ce15-0a3c-4c65-9b4e-22ca75f72c33.png)

You can see that each state is being held for quite a few clock cycles. 

The new reference program had different and new instructions that weren't implemented in our original CPU, therefore me and Shreya added them and their corresponding control signals. Each instruction was tested if it worked individually. 

**ADD:**
This was the easiest to add as it was a basic instrcution.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208181475-cd255edb-6fd7-428a-b587-271e8fbd8389.png)

We created assembly code to test if the individual instruction was working or not and we found using debugging displays that it did. Register 11 (a1) and register 12 (a2) should store 50 and when the *ADD* instruction is carried out then output a0 should be 100, which it was. So it meant that it worked.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208182517-a34033a1-1182-4dfe-8b0c-2612c5ccb62c.png)

**J:**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208183192-a14f379e-20b6-4f68-a30f-5b3df5b5314f.png)

Using the slides, we realised the *J* instruction was just a *JAL* instruction therefore we tested with a specific pseudoinstruction like so:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208183537-9e2ef949-08e5-44bd-bdcf-5cba1c4a1dec.png)

It should jump back to the top of the main loop, and it does.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208183786-967aae27-ad4b-418b-b65c-721e20d8a279.png)

**LUI/LI:**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208184045-48a1e557-a8a2-43ac-9d17-8910843c349b.png)

From the slides I realised that this instruction was a version of the *ADDI* instruction however it's still been implemented separately. To test it we used the following assembly code.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208184115-a6199b5f-376f-4108-8bdb-cc865e800d56.png)

The *LI/LUI* instruction is just meant to work like *ADDI* and store the chosen value into the chosen register. In this case it should make the output a0, from register 10 (x10), be 0xff, which it does.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208184623-a7233d84-e674-4b46-bd2b-7771fb895713.png)


These four instructions below were in the datamem.sv

**SW:**

This instruction we decided to implement to understand the *SB* (store byte) instruction better. *SW* (store word) takes the whole 4 bytes and concatenates them together to form the word. 

**SB:**

Using the *SW* isntruction we implemented the *SB* instruction like so:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208188332-5638c537-cb2b-44e5-ae04-3139fcb2cece.png)

As explained in datamem.sv earlier, the last byte of the data coming into datamem is taken and stored in the chosen byte and you choose the byte using the last two bits of 'a_in'.

**LW:**

This instruction we decided to implement to understand the *LBU* (load byte unsigned) instruction better. *LW* (store word) splits the word into 4 bytes and stores them in datamem. 

**LBU:**

We implemented *LB* like so:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614234/208188396-05ab59c2-8706-47cd-bef8-b245e4560265.png)

However we needed to implement *LBU* not *LB* and the difference was *LBU* is sign extended with 0's. As said above, it doesn't go into the sign extend therefore Shreya had the idea to sign extend it in the top sheet top.sv. 

After all the instructions were added, I had to edit the testbench. At first I ran it without editing the testbench however this took more 30 minutes to compile the data in sine.mem, we added the simulation cycle number print at the bottom of the screen as well. This function had slowed down the process alot as well. It did plot it in the end but this is not at all efficient, therefore I then sat down and tried to edit the testbench so that not every a0 output would be plotted.

>`int plot = 0;` is for the the reference program. I introduced this new  is because plotting every a0 result would take up a lot of time, therefore to prioritise and plot points where a0 > 0, i added this variable and used it in the three for loops inside the big simulation for loop.

>`vbdPlot(int(top->a0), 0, 255)` is the function to plot output a0. 

Using if statements, I made sure that only the points above 0 were plotted. The code is below:

## **Reflection:**

There are a few things that could've been done better on my part. When I next do this, I would do the list of things below differently:

- I would've given better commit names, as it was hard tracing back to link the commits in my write up. Towards the end I did improve.
- I would've annotated diagrams and made notes to put in my write up as I only have screenshots and annotations would show my understanding a bit better.
