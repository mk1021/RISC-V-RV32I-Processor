**Introduction**

This module was a rollercoaster of emotions, I cried, laughed, smiled, and even flipped tables over to try and get this CPU running. Despite the bad days, it was worth it because this is by far one of the best modules on this course. I learnt so much during this module, from the basics of RISC V to the assembly code and instruction sets used for the CPU.
As a group, we proceeded with this lab by splitting up the following schematic into four segments. 
<img width="618" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108066429/208204864-d2714659-90b5-4fc7-9ea0-3b22dca89a55.png">

I was assigned the Control Unit, Instruction memory, and sign extend blocks. The most challenging part was deciphering the lecture slides and linking them to the Risc-V processor. I figured out that the system verilog was the same as LAB 1- 3 but to utilise the whole Risc-V we now write the assembly language into the .mem files which implements the assembly code. 

**Control Unit**

For the control unit, I used an always_comb loop with IF/ELSE statements with the correlating bits and instructions.

So for example, for branch not equal we can see above that the opcode is 1100011 and the funct3 code is 001 so in the control unit I wrote the following if statement: 

```sv
 else if (InstrD_in[6:0] == 7'b1100011 && InstrD_in[14:12] == 3'b001) // bne
 begin
    if (!EQ_in)begin 
        PCsrc_out = 2'b01;  
    end
 end
```

Where InstrD_in [6:0] is the opcode for branch and [14:12] is funct3 (as seen below.)

<img width="530" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 14 58 25" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108066429/208125903-74ee94be-b193-4f60-93b5-83232628a5af.png">

Initially I didn‚Äôt have the IF statement but then Shreya and Monika realised that the branch is connected to EQ therefore we should use an if statement. So, in the IF statement, we used the schematic to see when PCsrc_out should be 2‚Äôb01, so when EQ (Zero in the ALU) is not true then we want PCsrc_out with the output ‚Äò2‚Äôb01‚Äô which is wired in the mux in top.sv and outputs PC + Immop which is the PC output for branch. So, if the branch is not equal it goes to PC = BTA which is coded in the assembly code and tells the branch to jump back to a previous loop in the assembly code(for example.) 

I did this for [addi](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/b46be76a0a30e9627718779a498607724a6d8157), bne, [jal](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/d260b76949b14a52fd6ef675ecb9db50b12b3e30), [jalr](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/1b36537e0e46f480cd0ec5261c15311636f33d68) as this is what we initially needed for Lab4 and my teammates (Shreya and Monika) did the rest of the instructions later in the coursework.  

**Sign Extend**

Next for the sign extend, each instruction has 12 bits so to extend it to 32 I did 20 * the most significant and then added the rest of the 12 bits to make a total of 32 bits. So, for example the Immediates for bne are not in order so we sign extend Instr[31] (Imm[12]), then put it in the rest of the Immediates so Instr(7)  is Imm[11], Instr [30:25] is Imm[10:5], and Instr[11:8] is Imm[4:1]. I then added 1‚Äôb0 in the least significant bit as one of the requirements is that the least significant bit is zero.

```sv
  always_comb begin
    case(ImmSrc_in)
      2'b00: ImmOp_out = {{20{instr_in[31]}},{instr_in[7]},{instr_in[30:25]},{instr_in[11:8]}, {1'b0}}; //bne
      2'b01: ImmOp_out = {{20{instr_in[31]}},{instr_in[31:20]}}; //addi
      2'b10: ImmOp_out = {{20{instr_in[31]}},{instr_in[31:20]}}; //jal - i type instruction so addi and jal are same
      2'b11: ImmOp_out = {{12{instr_in[31]}},{instr_in[19:12]},{instr_in[20]}, {instr_in[30:21]}, {1'b0}}; //jal
    endcase
  end
 ```
 
**The final block**

Instruction memory was quite simple as it was very similar to the ROM I made in Lab 2. I made the ROM then for the output Instruction I struggled understanding what to write but my teammate (Bilal) and I figured out that we should concatenate four incrementing PC outputs into the ROM instruction. 
```sv
always_comb begin
    //output is asynchronous
    Instr_out = {{rom_array[PC_in]},{rom_array[PC_in+1]},{rom_array[PC_in+2]},{rom_array[PC_in+3]}};
end 
```
(For pipelining I later realised that this is concatonated in big endian form, however doing it in little endian form would've been a lot better. However we left it in big endian form as we did not have enough time to change our instrmem.mem.)

**top.sv**

Finally, I made top.sv and wired all the inputs and outputs together, my teammates (Monika and Shreya) then did the muxes and cleaned up errors that occurred such as missing pins, width errors and logic errors in the muxes. 

# PIPELINING 

Pipelining was a journey! (I even went to hospital because of stress induced vomitting üôÅ) However, before falling severely ill, I began this process by analysing the schematic (with the help of my teammate Bilal.) I figured out that we need to add four new synchronous registers in between the four blocks so that the instructions are enabled at the same time but with one clock cycle delay. In the schematic below I [made the registers](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/02ada9ea37f6bcaf6b64ad10b568664d6e6af175) after the instruction memory (instrmemclk.sv) and the one after register file (regfileclk.sv). (Bilal did ALUclk.sv and datamemclk.sv.) I also [editted the top.sv](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/c69e4629fb8d96de17aca401eba41af993a43a1b) and adjusted the wiring by adding the registers, their pins and connecting the new wires to the other sheets accordingly. Initially we forgot about the control unit wires (the wires in blue in the schematic) so I then [added those in](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/af4002bedaf291f551eb1e9ae4f7b42808317e25) and the wiring was complete. 

<img width="608" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 15 10 32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108066429/208128266-0df88827-064b-4a01-9fd1-15961e08cf11.png">

After completing this wiring, all four of us wired the OR and AND gate in the top.sv, however Bilal then figured out that we could use a xor gate. We tried this in the top.sv and realised it‚Äôs the equivalent of using OR and AND gates so we left the logic as below initially, but then realised we need to use funct3 so then changed it back to the xor logic below. However, upon reflection both are very similar and there was no visible change in the outputs from the CPU when we changed it to the xor gate.  
xor logic:
```sv
assign PCsrcE = JumpE || (BranchE & (EQ ^ funct3E));
```
AND and OR logic(for this logic we removed funct3 from the top.sv wiring completely):
```sv
assign PCsrcE = JumpE || (BranchE & EQ);
```
For the working f1  and initial reference we used the xor logic, then when debugging we changed the logic in the final pipeline version to the one below to suit bne and branch equal respectively:
```sv
assign PCsrcE = JumpE | (BranchE & (!EQ & (funct3E == 3'b001)) | (EQ & (funct3E == 3'b000)));
```
**Debugging**

The trickiest part was the muxes for PC and Results, we wired them as below but had many issues as the F1 light was not working properly.  

```sv
always_comb begin
    case(ResultSrcW)
      2'b00: ResultW = ALUresultW; //bne, addi, slli
      2'b01: ResultW = ReadDataW; //lw
      2'b10: ResultW = PCPlus4W; //jal 
      default: ResultW = ALUresultW;
    endcase
  end
  
always_comb begin
    PCPlus4F = PC + 4;
    case({{JumpRegE},{PCsrcE}})
    2'b00: next_PC = PCPlus4F; //addi/slli
    2'b01: next_PC = PCE + ImmOpE; //branch
    2'b10: next_PC = ALUresult; //jlr
    default: next_PC = PCPlus4F;
    endcase 
end
```

To try solve this I drew the schematic out by hand to try see any wrong wiring or missing logic, attached below.

<img width="909" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108066429/208146936-d7246bb0-0c34-44bd-83b1-2ec9681e1570.png">

Whilst drawing the schematic I realised the writedataE wire coming out of the ALU was missing so the rd2E wire wasn‚Äôt going to the ALUclk.sv. I added this in, and the pipeline started to work successfully, however it worked with a different instrmem.mem. We then had a look at our instructions and realised that due to the no ops we had to change the instructions. So, for example, we had a jump to the third instruction but due to the no ops being added it jumped to the line with the second instruction, so we adjusted the instructions accordingly and the F1 sequence finally worked successfully! (correct code in f1_pipeline_working)

Unfortunately, we then realised that we needed to update the ALU and control unit with all the instructions as many of them were missing, therefore the pipeline CPU wasn‚Äôt functioning with the reference code.  
ALU:
```sv
 always_comb begin
        case (ALUctrlE)
            4'b0000: Sum_out = ALUctrlE[3] ? ALUop1_in - ALUop2_in : ALUop1_in + ALUop2_in; // SUB ADD
            4'b0001: Sum_out = ALUop1_in << ALUop2_in; //SLL
            4'b0010: Sum_out = ALUop1_in & ALUop2_in; // AND
            4'b0011: Sum_out = ALUop1_in | ALUop2_in; // OR
            4'b0101: Sum_out = ALUop1_in < ALUop2_in ? 1:0; // set less than 
            4'b0100: Sum_out = ALUop1_in ^ ALUop2_in; // XOR
            4'b0110: Sum_out = ALUctrlE[3] ? ALUop1_in >>> ALUop2_in[4:0] : ALUop1_in >> ALUop2_in[4:0]; // SRA SRL
            4'b0111: Sum_out = ALUop1_in << ALUop2_in; // left shift
            4'b1111: Sum_out = ALUop2_in;
            default: Sum_out = ALUop1_in;
        endcase

   end
    always EQ_out = (ALUop1_in == ALUop2_in);
endmodule
``` 
Bilal and I added the instructions into ALU, and copied the complete instructions in the control unit from the single cycle (done by Shreya and Monika.); we also updated the datamem.sv and signextend.sv with their version too. However, after completing this we found that the pipeline stopped working due to an unknown error so we used the display code below to debug the CPU and analyse the PCE, a0 and other outputs.  

<img width="274" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 23 20 22" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108066429/208204251-c8d436c5-0874-4edc-b2c4-e48a5931d7ed.png">

After much debugging we realised there was not enough time to figure out the primary issue so instead we decided to try completely change the control unit. We put this in the new folder "pipeline_cu_changed". THIS IS THE MOST UP TO DATE PIPELINING FOR REFERENCE CODE. However, we were still unsuccessful so decided to just be grateful we at least had f1 sequence working! 

**Self Reflection**

**Growth**

Throughout the past 10 weeks my knowledge on risc-v has increased exponentially. Some major skills I have picked up are learning to use and operate terminal on my macbook (apple supremacy!!) and also learning how to use github. I have enjoyed learning and understanding system verilog, risc-v instruction sets and assembly codes. I have also learnt how to debug and understand gtk waves results to fix issues in coding. 

**Learning Curves**

During this project I made a few mistakes when wiring schematics due to rushing into wiring rather than fully understanding lectures before commencing. 
I also learnt how top debug quite late, learning this earlier could have saved me a lot of time and I may have been able to debug and finish the pipeline. Fixing the pipeline is definitely something I will be working on during the holiday. 

**The Future**

After completing this project I would fully understand everyone's code rather than just my own from the start. This would have helped me a lot with debugging and changing the pipelined CPU. I'd also have asked for more help from other students and UTAs as this could've helped my understanding on this module a lot more quicker allowing me to focus on coding and fixing sooner.
