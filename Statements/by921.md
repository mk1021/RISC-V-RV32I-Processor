## Introduction

In this project we successfully designed our own single cycle CPU as well as creating a pipelined version of the CPU. I was assigned the role of initially contributing to the Program Counter module and then later on creating the Pipelined Branch alongside my lab partner Hana. The project was highly engaging and ensured we were able to apply theory in a practical application while establishing relations with previously unfamiliar fellow EIE students.

## pc.sv

The Program Counter (PC) is a register which takes and stores the address for the next instruction the processor will excecute. I initially just used the PC that was designed in [Lab 4](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/701641e29957caab56bd4089be465ea88c0a4b2d#diff-126540eeb309fc07577839cb956b8e6ffdf280d17e74256a593fe72c7ad8d4d3). However the schematic for the project brief meant that the previous model could not be followed as there were new components

```sv
module pc#(
    parameter D_WIDTH = 32
)(
    input  logic                            clk_in,
    input  logic                            rst_in,
    output logic        [D_WIDTH-1:0]       PC_out,
    input  logic        [D_WIDTH-1:0]       next_PC
    
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk_in) begin
        if (rst_in) PC_out <= 0; 
        else PC_out <= next_PC;
    end
    
    // always_comb begin
    //     $display("\n\n\nPC:  ", PC_out);
    // end

endmodule
```




The register takes in the value of Next_PC and then outputs PC_out however it is clocked. The always_ff block updates the value of PC on the rising clock edge, if reset is high then the PC is set to 0 else the PC takes the value of Next_PC.

## Pipelining

Pipelining the processor would in theory increase the speed at which programmes would be executed. This is due to multiple instructions now being able to be run at one time.

After Monica and Shreya initially completed the single cycle processor, Hana and I began to work on the pipelined version. We began by first analysing the schematic from Lecture 8 to see the changes that needed to be made.

From the schematic the main difference that we saw was there were 4 new asynchronous registers that were after Instruction Memory, Register File, ALU and Data Memory. Hana made the instrmemclk and regfileclk wheras I made the aluclk and datamemclk files together on the [same device](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/02ada9ea37f6bcaf6b64ad10b568664d6e6af175). This was a relatively straight forward task however it took some time ensuring that all the wires were added correctly (everyone did the wiring).

In order to see where the problems laid we added 5 NOPs between each instruction as this would mean if the code didnt run then the problem was with our hardware. One problem that I realised was that we missed out a wire at the bottom of the schematic which passed through all of the newly added registers. We realised that although it was a [quick fix](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/6aecf7e77b3fc1d1ed9f0ea42bd5a4fee0aa7f36) without it our pipelining would be completely incorrect as the PC value was not coming from the PCPlus4 MUX.

Hana also noticed that there were wires missing between ALU and the ALUclk files.
One key design change to which I contributed primarily was that I realised their should be a [XOR Gate](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/iac-riscv-cw-33/commit/f97bec65559199d0ffd1288ad0e308b57f534e23) added into the top.sv file. Initially our group did not use Funct3 but here it was needed as an input into the gate. Although it made sense theoretically it did not make any changes to the CPU outputs.

After these changes however our pipelining still didnt appear to work. In order to check our wiring Hana made a hand drawn schematic. From this we deduced that our ALU aswell as the control unit had many missing instructions and due to that the reference codes would not run. In order to fix this issue Hana and I added the instructions to the ALU and added the complete instructions from the single cycle into the Control Unit (courtesy of Shreya and Monika). Although we believed this would fix our problems it still would not work for the reference code.

## Reflection

### What I learnt

Through the course of the last few weeks I have been able to apply the knowledge learnt during lectures and understand more clearly RISCV 32 bit integer instruction set architecture. By being able to physically apply what I know practically my understanding of content taught has improved and I have also gained valuable knowledge on using GitHub and Linux. I have also gained very valuable practical experience in how to debug code and what "call signs" to look out for depending on the errors.

### Problems Encountered

During this project at many points I would find that I would not pay enough attention when doing something for the first time. I would assign the incorrect number of bits or miss the most basic wires while working in top.sv. During various stages of the project I also had many problems with running WSL on my device as ubuntu would keep crashing or have other issues which meant I would be reliant on using other's devices.

### Differences in the Future

If I was to do this project again I would ensure that the single cycle stage is fully functional and without any bugs before commencing with the extension such as pipelining. This is because it means you do not have to spend time debugging both branches at the same time. I would also like to ensure that we document our progress as we go instead of collecting all the results last minute. Finally, I would make sure that I have complete understanding of all the lectures before commencing with certain parts of the project to make sure I dont make silly errors and then have to spend even more time finding and fixing those issues.
